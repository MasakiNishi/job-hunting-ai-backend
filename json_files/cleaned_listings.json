We've built exchange matching engines at scale, published AI papers at top journals, and exited startups to Fortune 500 companies prior to Magna.\n\nOur stack is primarily TypeScript (frontend + backend monorepo) and Rust (protocol + systems engineering).

We currently average over $1M of transaction volume per day and have hundreds of thousands of users.\n\u2022 Building in an engineering-first space. Web3 is predicated on decentralized and open access compute resources, which engineers are best positioned to take advantage of.\n\u2022 Shipping fast. We sit at the center of the space in terms of our investors and customers, and are known as being a team that delivers across multiple ecosystems.\n\nSome example projects areas we've taken on are:\n\u2022 Performance: Aggregating across multi-chain data sources to build a cache for historical blockchain transactions and price data.\n\u2022 Features: Implementing transaction flows for customers managing financial operations at scale (e.g. managing 200K+ asset distributions through the self-serve product).\n\u2022 Architecture: Migrating internal systems & libraries to an event-based architecture for readability + developer experience.\n\u2022 User Experience: Designing consumer-oriented interactions for end-user portfolio management (e.g. fun animations on claiming).\n\nWhat We Offer\n\u2022 Unlimited PTO.

This is not just bad for business; it's bad for everyone. Information asymmetry has led to social inequality, scandals, polarization, and corruption. Sometimes, it has even led to war. Centralized data control acts as a potential chokepoint for innovation, raises privacy concerns, and creates a bottleneck for the free flow of data.\n\nOpenmesh is a cutting-edge new open-source cloud infrastructure and a global open data network aimed at storing important global data without a middleman. It is the largest open web3 data lake, covering approximately 80% of the entire crypto and web3 ecosystem today. In 2023 and 2024, we aim to expand our data coverage to include public health and scientific research data.\n\nOpenmesh enables anyone to create their own decentralized data cloud, connect globally, share data securely, slash deployment costs, and automate data cloud setup. The Openmesh Network is designed to collect, store, process, stream, and provide data connectivity for anyone, anywhere, anytime, without the need for registration, licensing, or payments. Think of Openmesh as the internet's open data fabric. It grants universal access and prevents interferences created by regulators, governments, corporations, and even its own creators. The possibilities are endless.\n\nCore Products\n\u2022 Our flagship product, Xnode, is an integral part of this vision, offering a revolutionary platform for developers to build decentralized data clouds. Xnode, enables developers to build their own decentralized data clouds with data connectivity, data APIs, and query & analytics engines in mere minutes, instead of weeks or months. They pay only for computing and storage, sidestepping licensing and setup fees. Xnode facilitates a 10-15 fold cost reduction in running and operating data clouds and can save over 95% of deployment time.\n\u2022 Pythia is a powerhouse analytics & query engine that transforms raw data into actionable insights. Pythia allows anyone to design, build, visualize, and deploy powerful data products.\n\u2022 Unified APIs provide a single endpoint for all crypto & web3 data, making it accessible to anyone, anywhere, without any costs. There are no licenses, registrations, or setup fees involved.\n\nOur vision\n\nOur vision is to democratize data and address information asymmetry at a scale. Data & information is the most valuable commodity in the world. Without quality, reliable data, all webpages, apps, and the entire internet will stop working. We believe access to reliable, unedited information is a fundamental right- an aspect of a free and democratic society. The Core Principles of Openmesh, by design, has no single authority that can alter its data, how the information is distributed or controlled, or who can see what and when. The infrastructure and entire technology stack is open-source and governed by an open-source community.\n\nThe opportunity\n\u2022 Leverage this paid internship opportunity to fulfill your PEP 40H industry experience requirement.\n\u2022 Learn groundbreaking innovations in Data, Cloud, Blockchain, AI, and Web3 Infrastructure from visionaries, senior engineers, product owners and discover what your dream job is really like.\n\u2022 You will be given access to our open source technology, hackathons, virtual conferences, mentoring sessions, R&D infrastructure, workshops, and an opportunity to observe and apply your knowledge in practice.

    "description": "About Us:\n\nWe're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.\n\nWe've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.\n\nNotion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day). This internship will take place from January - April and you will need to be able to work out of our NY or SF office during this time.\n\nAbout The Role:\n\nMillions of people use Notion \u2014 and this number is increasing every day. That means a million people trust us to deliver a fast, reliable, and secure experience, and we value this more than anything. We want to keep earning trust, while also continuing to amaze our users with the tools they can build in Notion. This is where you come in. You will be a part of our first engineering internship class and will help us forge a performant and reliable path forward to Notion's future.\n\nDuring your 12-week internship, you will be paired with a mentor that will help guide you as you work closely with our team to build and ship impactful projects. These projects will drive valuable impact to our customers and engineers. From product engineering, mobile, to infrastructure and security, we have opportunities available on different teams. Take a look at what our past intern cohort worked on with our Blog post here and here and TikTok post.\n\nWhat You'll Achieve:\n\u2022 Write clean, secure, tested, and documented code.\n\u2022 Design & enhance the Notion platform with new capabilities, as and when the need arises.\n\u2022 Design, develop, and own new product functionality and/or infrastructure leveraging modern frameworks and tooling.\n\u2022 Develop, fix and debug software for web services, databases, applications, tools, networks.\n\nQualifications:\n\u2022 Pursuing a bachelor's or master's degree in computer science, engineering, or another related field. Targeting a 2025 or early 2026 full-time start date and must graduate in between June 2025 - December 2025.\n\u2022 Previous internship experience.\n\u2022 Working towards a proficiency of one or more programming languages such as Typescript, Node.js, Go, Python, Java, Swift, Rust, or Kotlin.\n\u2022 You find large challenges exciting and enjoy discovering problems as much as solving them.\n\u2022 You are able to problem-solve and adapt to changing priorities in a fast-paced, dynamic environment.\n\u2022 This internship will take place from Jan - Apr and you will need to be able to work out of our NY or SF office during this time.\n\nSkills You\u2019ll Need To Bring:\n\u2022 Thoughtful problem-solving: For you, problem-solving starts with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You can decompose tricky problems and work towards a clean solution, by yourself or with teammates. You're comfortable asking for help when you get stuck.\n\u2022 For a backend internship: You have a passion for learning how parts of a system fit together\u2014from the user interface to the data model. Familiarity with relational database systems like Postgres or MySQL is a plus.\n\u2022 For a frontend internship: You have a passion for learning technologies (CSS, Javascript, & React) and best practices in front-end architecture, including performance, accessibility and usability.\n\u2022 Put users first: You think critically about the implications of what you're building, and how it shapes real people's lives. You understand that reach comes with responsibility for our impact\u2014good and bad.\n\u2022 Not ideological about technology: To you, technologies and programming languages are about tradeoffs. You may be opinionated, but you're not ideological and can learn new technologies as you go.\n\u2022 Empathetic communication: You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you're explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real time. In disagreements, you engage thoughtfully with other perspectives and compromise when needed.\n\u2022 Team player: For you, work isn't a solo endeavor. You enjoy collaborating cross-functionally to accomplish shared goals, and you care about learning, growing, and helping others to do the same.\n\nNice to Haves:\n\u2022 You have expertise with specific technologies that are part of our stack, including Typescript, React, Electron, Node.js, AWS, and Postgres.\n\u2022 You've heard of computing pioneers like Ada Lovelace, Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, and others\u2014and understand why we're big fans of their work.\n\u2022 You have interests outside of technology, such as in art, history, or social sciences.\n\nOur customers come from all walks of life and so do we. We hire great people from a wide variety of backgrounds, not just because it's the right thing to do, but because it makes our company stronger. If you share our values and our enthusiasm for small businesses, you will find a home at Notion.\n\nNotion is proud to be an equal opportunity employer.

By bringing the right data to the people who need it, our platforms empower our partners to develop lifesaving drugs, forecast supply chain disruptions, locate missing children, and more.\n\nThe Role\n\nSoftware Engineers at Palantir build software at scale to transform how organizations around the world use data. As a Software Engineer Intern, you\u2019ll have an opportunity to grow more quickly than you ever envisioned, as you contribute high-quality code directly to Palantir Gotham, Palantir Foundry, or Palantir Apollo: products that are deployed at some of the most important institutions across the public and private sectors. You'll create features used by research scientists, aerospace engineers, intelligence analysts, and economic forecasters, in countries around the world. Palantir's Product Development organization is made up of small teams of Software Engineers, each focusing on a specific aspect of a product. For example, you might join a team that builds a Foundry front-end application, or a component of the Gotham release infrastructure. We encourage communication and collaboration among teams to share context, skills, and experience, so you'll learn about many different aspects of each product.\n\nCore Responsibilities\n\nAs a Software Engineer, you are involved throughout the product lifecycle - from idea generation, design, and prototyping to execution and shipping while also being paired with a mentor dedicated to your growth and success. You'll collaborate closely with technical and non-technical counterparts to understand our customers' problems and build products that tackle them. One of the most effective ways to understand what our users need is to meet them. You may receive an opportunity to tour the assembly line at an auto-manufacturer or join a counter-terror analyst at their desk to really understand their mission and difficulties.\n\nSWE Principles Include\n\u2022 Ownership: We see projects through from beginning to end in spite of obstacles we may encounter.\n\u2022 Collaboration: We work internally with people from a variety of backgrounds \u2014 such as other Software Engineers, Product Managers, Designers and Product Reliability Engineers. We also partner with our business development teams (Forward Deployed Engineers, Deployment Strategists) in order to understand and solve our customers' problems.\n\u2022 Trust: We trust each other to effectively handle time and priorities, and don't micromanage. We want people to have the space to think for themselves, while feeling supported by their team.\n\nTechnologies We Use\n\nSkills\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter what languages you know when you join us, but it does matter that you can write clean, effective code and learn new languages quickly. Our software is constantly evolving, so we need engineers who can do the same. Alongside peers that bring diverse experience - whether you\u2019re a former university TA, switched to CS recently, or are a hackathon enthusiast \u2014 you'll build your skills to apply the best technology to solve a given problem. Right now, we use:\n\u2022 Varying languages, including Java and Go for backend and Typescript for frontend\n\u2022 Open-source technologies like Cassandra, Spark, Elasticsearch, React, and Redux\n\u2022 Industry-standard build tooling, including Gradle, Webpack, and GitHub\n\nWhat We Value\n\u2022 Ability to communicate and collaborate with a variety of individuals, including engineers, users and non-technical team members.\n\u2022 Willingness to learn and make decisions independently, and the ability to ask questions when needed.\n\u2022 Active US Security clearance, or eligibility and willingness to obtain a US Security clearance.\n\nWhat We Require\n\u2022 Engineering background in fields such as Computer Science, Mathematics, Software Engineering, and Physics.\n\u2022 Familiarity with data structures, storage systems, cloud infrastructure, front-end frameworks, and other technical tools.\n\u2022 Experience coding in programming languages, such as Java, C++, Python, JavaScript, or similar languages.\n\u2022 Must be planning on graduating in 2026. This should be your final internship before graduating.\n\nTo Apply, Please Submit The Following\n\u2022 An updated resume / CV - please do so in PDF format.\n\u2022 Thoughtful responses to our application questions.\n\nOffer Deadline\n\nIn an effort to build more transparency into our recruitment process, we\u2019d like to share our offer deadline expectations. By applying to this position, you commit to confirming your decision within two weeks of receiving your written offer.\n\nSalary\n\nThe estimated salary range for this position is estimated to be $10,000/month. Further note that total compensation for this position will be determined by each individual\u2019s relevant qualifications, work experience, skills, and other factors. This estimate excludes the value of any benefits offered; and the potential future value of any long-term incentives.\n\nLife at Palantir\n\nWe want every Palantirian to achieve their best outcomes, that\u2019s why we celebrate individuals\u2019 strengths, skills, and interests, from your first interview to your longterm growth, rather than rely on traditional career ladders. Paying attention to the needs of our community enables us to optimize our opportunities to grow and helps ensure many pathways to success at Palantir. Promoting health and well-being across all areas of Palantirians\u2019 lives is just one of the ways we\u2019re investing in our community. Learn more at Life at Palantir and note that our offerings may vary by region.\n\nIn keeping consistent with Palantir\u2019s values and culture, we believe employees are \u201cbetter together\u201d and in-person work affords the opportunity for more creative outcomes. Therefore, we encourage employees to work from our offices to foster connectivity and innovation. Many teams do offer hybrid options (WFH a day or two a week), allowing our employees to strike the right trade-off for their personal productivity. Based on business need, there are a few roles that allow for \u201cRemote\u201d work on an exceptional basis. If you are applying for one of these roles, you must work from the state in which you are employed.
